## Heart-Failure-Prediction

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide.

Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Binary Features:
  - Anaemia (Decrease of Red BLood Cells or Hemoglobin)
  - High blood pressure (Hypertension)
  - Diabetes (If the patient has diabetes)
  - Smoking (If the patient smokes)
  - Sex (Man or Women)
  
Continuous Features:
  - Creatinine phosphokinase CPK (Level of the CPK enzyme in the blood in mcg/L)
  - Ejection fraction (Percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction)
  - Serum Sodium (Level of Sodium in the blood in mEq/L) 
  - Serum Creatinine (Level of Creatininie in the blood in mg/dL)
  - Platelets (Platelets in the blood in kiloplatelets/mL)
  - Time (Follow-up period in Days)
 
 Target Class:
  - Death Event (If the patient died during follow-up period)
